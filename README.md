## About:
This is asyncio telegram bot build with aiogram library.
He is tracking links you sent to him and get you notified when new product is showing.
You can find working example by click this [link](https://t.me/AvitoTrackBot)
## Payment:
Every user has a chance to test it free with only one active worker, but subscription can break the limit. 
I've used yoomoney system to integrate payments to make it all possible. Subscribtion is very cheap and flexible, cause every user can define exact 
number of days he wants bot to do its job. Also, user can define number of active workers.
